I am a fifth year CSE PhD student at The Ohio State University, advised by [Xia Ning](https://cse.osu.edu/people/ning.104) and co-advised by [Srinivasan Parthasarathy](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parthasarathy.2/). I graduated from the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University with a bachelor degree in 2018.

My thesis research focuses on deep generative models and reinforcement learning, particularly their applications in drug discovery. My previous research projects include 2D and 3D molecule generation, molecular synthesis, and biological sequence design. 

I have worked on developing novel models for recommendation in both Meta and Google as summer internships. I'm also generally interested in recommender systems, GenAI and LLMs. Currently, I am actively seeking full-time positions in the industry!

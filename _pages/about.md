I am a fifth year CSE PhD student at The Ohio State University, advised by [Xia Ning](https://cse.osu.edu/people/ning.104) and co-advised by [Srinivasan Parthasarathy](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parthasarathy.2/). I graduated from the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University with a bachelor degree in 2018.

My research interests focus on deep generative models and reinforcement learning, particularly their applications in drug discovery. My previous research includes molecule generation, molecular synthesis, and biological sequence design.

Currently, I am actively seeking internship opportunities as well as full-time positions in the industry!
